        Narrator: My dear children, young and old, each character of this tale is represented by an instrument in the orchestra
      the bird, by flute (flute noise plays), the duck by an oboe (oboe plays), a cat by a clarinet in a low register, a grandfather by a bassoon,
      the world by a horn, Peter by the string instruments, the shooting of the hunters by kettle drums
      And now dear children, here is our story.
        <br>
        <br>
        Early one morning Peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow.
        <br>
        <br>
        (**Instruments sound accordingly in symphony**)
        <br>
        <br>
      On the branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend, "all is quiet," chirped the little bird, Gailey.
        <br>
        <br>
        (**Flute noises play, followed by symphony noises**)
        <br>
        <br>
        Soon a duck came waddling around. She was glad that Peter had not closed the gate and decided to have a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow.
        <br>
        <br>
        (**Instruments sound accordingly in symphony**)
        <br>
        <br>
        When the little bird saw the duck, he flew down, settled himself in the grass behind the duck and shrugged his shoulders.
        <br>
        <br>
        (**Instruments sound accordingly in symphony**)
        <br>
        <br>
        What kind of bird are you, if you can't fly? Said he.
